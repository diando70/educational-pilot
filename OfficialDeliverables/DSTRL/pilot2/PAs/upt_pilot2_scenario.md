## 5. Implementation and Testing Progress

* **Scenario status**: Completed
* **Number of users onboarded**:

* **Issues encountered**:
  Minor initial configuration requirements for Romanian regulatory context, successfully resolved
* **Deviation from plan**:
  No significant deviations, implementation proceeded as planned with successful completion of all key objectives

## 6. Testing Results and Observations

* **What worked as expected**:
  * PKI certificate infrastructure deployment successful
  * ATOS issuer platform integration completed
  * IZERTIS wallet integration functional
  * PID retrieval user journey executed successfully
  * EducationalID issuance and verification completed
  * Educational Achievement (Micro-credential) issuance and verification completed
  * Graduate student onboarding process effective
  * W3C Verifiable Credentials implementation successful
  * Romanian regulatory compliance achieved
* **What did not work and why**:
  * Minor performance considerations for scaling beyond pilot scope
  * Some initial user familiarisation requirements for digital credential concepts
* **Feedback from users**:
  Positive response from graduate students, particular appreciation for Micro-credential digitisation and potential for international academic mobility, negative for teh complicated method for those with minimum digital skills, without training only a few could have succeded
* **Impact on user experience and feasibility**:
  Demonstrates successful feasibility of hybrid trust model approach for Romanian technical university context. Strong potential demonstrated for enhancing graduate student mobility and credential recognition across Europe.
